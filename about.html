<h4>Hi &#128075;&#127995;, my name is Shaya Udoff</h4> ...and let me introduce myself.<br><br>

As Confucius is often contributed to have said

<br><i>"Choose a job you love, and you never have to work a day in your life"</i><br><br>

So with that in mind, I believe entrepreneurship is more than just a career path for me — it's a hobby.<br><br>

I’ve built multiple ventures from the ground up, including Glisten Glass Art, where I serve as CEO, turning creativity into a business that combines artistry and strategy.<br><br>

At UB Constructs, as co-founder and CFO, I manage finances and operations, learning how to balance risk and opportunity in real-time.<br><br>

I also help develop projects at Insiyt as CTO, applying technology and innovation to bring ideas to life.<br><br>

In addition to my ventures, I actively trade IPOs on Robinhood, exploring the financial markets and understanding how to grow wealth intelligently.<br><br>

I see every project—whether a startup, an investment, or a new skill—as a chance to challenge myself, learn, and improve.<br><br>

Studying Business Science allows me to deepen my knowledge of marketing, strategy, and leadership, giving me the tools to take my ideas further and make them sustainable.<br><br>

I thrive on new challenges and experiences, whether that’s traveling to new places, mountain biking the trails, or hitting the water for wakeboarding and wakesurfing.<br><br>

My goal is to combine creativity, discipline, and strategic thinking to build ventures that are both successful and meaningful.<br><br>

Everything I do is part of a larger mission: to learn, grow, and create opportunities that push me forward while inspiring others around me.
