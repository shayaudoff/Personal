      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi üëãüèΩ, my name is Shaya Udoff, and let me introduce myself.<br><br>

        As Confucius is often contributed to have said:<br>
        <i>"Choose a job you love, and you never have to work a day in your life"</i><br><br>

        So with that in mind, I believe entrepreneurship is more than just a career path for me ‚Äî it's a hobby.<br><br>

        I‚Äôve built multiple ventures from the ground up, including Glisten Glass Art, where I serve as CEO, turning creativity into a business that combines artistry and strategy.<br><br>

        At UB Constructs, as co-founder and CFO, I manage finances and operations, learning how to balance risk and opportunity in real-time.<br><br>

        I also help develop projects at Insiyt as CTO, applying technology and innovation to bring ideas to life.<br><br>

        In addition to my ventures, I actively trade IPOs on Robinhood, exploring the financial markets and understanding how to grow wealth intelligently.<br><br>

        I see every project‚Äîwhether a startup, an investment, or a new skill‚Äîas a chance to challenge myself, learn, and improve.<br><br>

        Studying Business Science allows me to deepen my knowledge of marketing, strategy, and leadership, giving me the tools to take my ideas further and make them sustainable.<br><br>

        I thrive on new challenges and experiences, whether that‚Äôs traveling to new places, mountain biking the trails, or hitting the water for wakeboarding and wakesurfing.<br><br>

        My goal is to combine creativity, discipline, and strategic thinking to build ventures that are both successful and meaningful.<br><br>

        Everything I do is part of a larger mission: to learn, grow, and create opportunities that push me forward while inspiring others around me.
